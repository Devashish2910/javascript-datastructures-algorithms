Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript
====================================
This repo is particularly about implementation of different Data Structures (some of their real life problem solving, too) and Algorithms in JavaScript.

# Warning:⚠️

3. [Linked List](#linkedlist)
3. [Recursion](#recursion)
4. [Sorting Algorithms](#sorting)

### <a name="stacks"></a>[1. Stackes][1]
1. stack.html
2. stack.js - Implementation of stack by using ES6 class and the methods like Push, Pop, Size, Peek, isEmpty, clear
3. minStack.js - Implementation of MinStack that has a min method which will return the minimum value in the stack in constant time.
4. Application
- Decimal To Binary Convertor
- Balanced Parenthesis Problem
- Infix to Postfix
- Infix to Prefix
- Evaluation of Postfix
- Largest area under histogram

### <a name="queues"></a>[2. Queues][2]
1. queue.html
2. queue.js - implementation of queue by using ES6 class and the methods like enqueue, dequeue, size, peek, isEmpty, clear, contains, print
3. Application
- Hot Popato Game (Circular Queue)
- Priority Queue
- Queue From Two Stacks

### <a name="linkedlist"></a>[3. Linked List][5]
1. linkedlist.html
2. linkedlist.js - implementation of Linked List with operations on it
3. Application
- Doubly Linked List and methods on it
- Circular Linked List and methods on it

### <a name="recursion"></a>[Recursion][3]
1. recursion.html
2. looping.js
- Write a function that loops through the numbers n down to 0. With while loop.
- Next, try looping just like above except using recursion
3. exponent.js
- Write a function 'exponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, uses a while loop to return the exponenet value of the base.
4. recursiveExponent.js
- Write a function 'RecursiveExponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, recursively returns exponent value of the base.
5. recursiveMultiplier.js
- Write a function 'recursiveMultiplier' that takes two arguments, 'arr and num', and multiplies each arr value into by num and returns an array of the values.
6. recursiveReverse.js
- Write a function 'recursiveReverse' that takes an array and uses recursion to return its contents in reverse
7. factorial.js
- Implement a recursive function which gives factorial of a given number.
8. reverse.js
- Implement a function that will reverse a string recursively.
9. fibonacci.js
- Implement Fibonacci Series With Recursion.

### <a name="sorting"></a>[Sorting Algorithms][4]
1. bubblesSort.js
- Implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm.

2. selectionSort.js
- Implemetation of Selection Sort Algorithm.

3. insertionSort.js
- Implementation of Insertion Sort Algorithm.
