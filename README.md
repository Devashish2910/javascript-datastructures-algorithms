- Infix to Postfix
- Infix to Prefix
- Evaluation of Postfix
- Largest area under histogram

### <a name="queues"></a>[2. Queues][2]
1. queue.html
2. queue.js - implementation of queue by using ES6 class and the methods like enqueue, dequeue, size, peek, isEmpty, clear, contains, print
3. Application
- Hot Popato Game (Circular Queue)
- Priority Queue
- Queue From Two Stacks

### <a name="linkedlist"></a>[3. Linked List][5]
1. linkedlist.html
2. linkedlist.js - implementation of Linked List with operations on it
3. Application
- Doubly Linked List and methods on it
- Circular Linked List and methods on it

### <a name="set"></a>[4. Set][6]
1. set.js - implementation of in-built data-structure 'Set' and uses of its methods 

### <a name="map"></a>[5. Map][7]
1. map.js - implementation of in-built data-structure 'Map' (Dictionary) and uses of its methods
2. HashMap
   - hashMap.js - implementation of data-structure 'HashMap' and some methods on it
   
### <a name="tree"></a>[6. Tree][8]
1. bst.js - implementation of in-built data-structure 'Tree' and methods on it
2. Node.js - a Node class which represents the structure of a node for tree

### <a name="recursion"></a>[Recursion][3]
1. recursion.html
2. looping.js
- Write a function that loops through the numbers n down to 0. With while loop.
- Next, try looping just like above except using recursion
3. exponent.js
- Write a function 'exponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, uses a while loop to return the exponenet value of the base.
4. recursiveExponent.js
- Write a function 'RecursiveExponent' that takes two arguments base, and expo, recursively returns exponent value of the base.
5. recursiveMultiplier.js
- Write a function 'recursiveMultiplier' that takes two arguments, 'arr and num', and multiplies each arr value into by num and returns an array of the values.
6. recursiveReverse.js
- Write a function 'recursiveReverse' that takes an array and uses recursion to return its contents in reverse
7. factorial.js
- Implement a recursive function which gives factorial of a given number.
8. reverse.js
- Implement a function that will reverse a string recursively.
9. fibonacci.js
- Implement Fibonacci Series With Recursion.

### <a name="sorting"></a>[Sorting Algorithms][4]
1. bubblesSort.js
- Implementation of Bubble Sort Algorithm.

2. selectionSort.js
- Implemetation of Selection Sort Algorithm.

3. insertionSort.js
- Implementation of Insertion Sort Algorithm.
